Several master trees are available through Phylomatic, each representing a slightly different phylogenetic hypothesis. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 3 (APG3) master tree ( The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2009 ) is the most up to date but has no option to include branch lengths. The master tree based on the phylogeny by Davies et al. (2004) also has no branch lengths. The conservative master tree based on the early Angiosperm Phylogeny Group study (APG1; Soltis et al., 2000 ) is outdated, but it provides the option of adding branch lengths by using the BladJ function in Phylomatic, based on dated nodes from Wikstrom et al. (2001) . Despite the uncertainty, these branch lengths are more realistic than the alternative of equal branch lengths because analyses based on trees with equal branch lengths are highly sensitive to incomplete taxon sampling ( Martins and Garland, 1991 ). All master trees are resolved to the family level, with additional resolution within some families provided by the authors of Phylomatic. To examine the effects of phylogenetic uncertainty, I ran my analyses using four master trees: APG3, the Davies et al. tree, APG1 with branch lengths, and APG1 without branch lengths. I used Mesquite version 2.6 ( Maddison and Maddison, 2009 ) to randomly resolve all polytomies to zero branch lengths and to prune trees as necessary to account for missing data in some traits.""

The Newick version of hte tree, and the alignment, are available from Dryad.l  However, the paper does not give an accession.   The other tree was assembled from other trees in the literature.  A number of references are cited.  It isn't clear precisely how this was done.  The tree consists of high-level frameworks.  The paper implies that the frameworks shown in Fig. 1 suffice to represent this tree, although I am not confident about that.  ",6/2/2011 2:24:21,"Phylogenetic relationships between Malcolmia, Strigosella, Zuvanda, and some closely related genera (Brassicaceae) from Turkey revealed by inter-simple sequence repeat amplification",,Dogan,doi:10.3906/bot-1006-40,Brian,none,"other molecular data (RFLP, AFLP, etc)",None (despite being generated),,Not applicable (no such re-use),None,Not applicable (no such data generated),Not applicable (no such re-use),Journal figure,None,They used  inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) to look at similarity of different species.,,6/6/2011 14:03:16,Phylogenetic relationships of selected European Ennominae (Lepidoptera: Geometridae),"[[Ounap, 2011 #104]]",Ounap,"Eur.
