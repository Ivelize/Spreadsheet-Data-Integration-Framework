 * Class that implements the concept of Adjustment function. An adjustment function is responsible of 
 * reflecting evidence from semantic matrices into purely syntactic scores by using a function to 
 * increase or decrease syntactic similarity. 
 * 
 * Each semantic matrix is associated with an adjustment function 
 * 
 * In future development these functions could be trained on data.
