      <Growth-Protocol> Chemostat Cultivation— Steady-state chemostat cultures were grown in Applikon laboratory fermentors of 1-liter working volume as described in detail elsewhere [van den Berg, M. A., de Jong-Gubbels, P., Kortland, C. J., van Dijken, J. P., Pronk, J. T., and Steensma, H. Y. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 28953–28959]. In brief, the cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium containing glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient [. Verduyn, C., Postma, E., Scheffers, W. A., and van Dijken, J. P. (1990) Microbiol.Rev. 58, 616–630]. The dilution rate (which equals the specific growth rate) in the steady-state cultures was 0.10 h_1, the temperature was 30 °C, and the culture pH was 5.0. Aerobic conditions were maintained by sparging the cultures with air (0.5 liter_min_1). The dissolved oxygen concentration, which was continuously monitored with an Ingold model 34-100-3002 probe, remained above 80% of air saturation. </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>polyA RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol> Sampling and RNA Isolation— Samples from the chemostat cultures were taken as rapidly as possible to limit any potential changes in transcript profiles during the procedure. 40–60 ml of culture broth was sampled directly from the chemostat into a beaker containing 200 ml of liquid nitrogen. With vigorous stirring, the sample froze instantly. The frozen sample was then broken into small fragments and transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube. The sample was then thawed at room temperature, ensuring that it remained as close to zero as possible. Cells were pelleted (5000 rpm at 0 °C for 4 min), resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold AE buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 5.0) and aliquoted into 5 Eppendorf tubes. This corresponded to _20 mg of dry weight per tube. For each array, total RNA was extracted from a single tube using the hot-phenol method (32) or the FastRNA kit, Red (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol> Probe Preparation and Hybridization to Arrays—mRNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cRNA synthesis and labeling, as well as array hybridization were performed as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Briefly, poly(A)_ RNA was enriched from total RNA in a single round using the Qiagen Oligotex kit. Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out incorporating the T7 RNA-polymerase promoter in the first round. This cDNA was then used as template for in vitro transcription (ENZO BioArray High Yield IVT kit), which amplifies the RNA pool and incorporates biotinylated ribonucleotides required for the staining procedures after hybridization. 15 mg of fragmented, biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix yeast S98 arrays at 45 °C for 16 h as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Washing and staining of arrays were performed using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and scanning with the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner.

    <Data-Processing> Data Acquisition and Primary Analysis— Acquisition and quantification of array images as well as primary data analysis were performed using the Affymetrix software packages: Microarray Suite version 4.0.1, MicroDB version 2.0, and Data Mining Tool version 2.0. Microsoft Excel was used for further statistical analyses. All arrays were globally scaled to a target value of 150 using the average signal from all gene features using Microarray Suite version 4.0.1. When pairwise comparisons were performed (using Microarray Suite version 4.0.1), a transcript was considered “changed” when a call of Increase or Decrease was made, the -fold change was at least 2, and the higher of the two average difference values was called present. </Data-Processing>

      <Growth-Protocol> Chemostat Cultivation— Steady-state chemostat cultures were grown in Applikon laboratory fermentors of 1-liter working volume as described in detail elsewhere [van den Berg, M. A., de Jong-Gubbels, P., Kortland, C. J., van Dijken, J. P., Pronk, J. T., and Steensma, H. Y. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 28953–28959]. In brief, the cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium containing glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient [. Verduyn, C., Postma, E., Scheffers, W. A., and van Dijken, J. P. (1990) Microbiol.Rev. 58, 616–630]. The dilution rate (which equals the specific growth rate) in the steady-state cultures was 0.10 h_1, the temperature was 30 °C, and the culture pH was 5.0. Aerobic conditions were maintained by sparging the cultures with air (0.5 liter_min_1). The dissolved oxygen concentration, which was continuously monitored with an Ingold model 34-100-3002 probe, remained above 80% of air saturation. Media— The defined mineral medium composition was based on that described by Verduyn et al [. Verduyn, C., Postma, E., Scheffers, W. A., and van Dijken, J. P. (1990) Microbiol.Rev. 58, 616–630]. The residual glucose concentration was targeted to 17 g_liter_1 to sustain glucose repression at the same level . For sulfur-limited, the composition was 4.0 g of NH4Cl, 0.05 g of MgSO4_7H2O, 3.0 g of KH2PO4, 0.4g of MgCl2, and 42 g of glucose. </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>polyA RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol> Sampling and RNA Isolation— Samples from the chemostat cultures were taken as rapidly as possible to limit any potential changes in transcript profiles during the procedure. 40–60 ml of culture broth was sampled directly from the chemostat into a beaker containing 200 ml of liquid nitrogen. With vigorous stirring, the sample froze instantly. The frozen sample was then broken into small fragments and transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube. The sample was then thawed at room temperature, ensuring that it remained as close to zero as possible. Cells were pelleted (5000 rpm at 0 °C for 4 min), resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold AE buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 5.0) and aliquoted into 5 Eppendorf tubes. This corresponded to _20 mg of dry weight per tube. For each array, total RNA was extracted from a single tube using the hot-phenol method (32) or the FastRNA kit, Red (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). </Extract-Protocol>

      <Label-Protocol> Probe Preparation and Hybridization to Arrays—mRNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cRNA synthesis and labeling, as well as array hybridization were performed as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Briefly, poly(A)_ RNA was enriched from total RNA in a single round using the Qiagen Oligotex kit. Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out incorporating the T7 RNA-polymerase promoter in the first round. This cDNA was then used as template for in vitro transcription (ENZO BioArray High Yield IVT kit), which amplifies the RNA pool and incorporates biotinylated ribonucleotides required for the staining procedures after hybridization. 15 mg of fragmented, biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix yeast S98 arrays at 45 °C for 16 h as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Washing and staining of arrays were performed using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and scanning with the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner. </Label-Protocol>

    <Data-Processing> Data Acquisition and Primary Analysis—Acquisition and quantification of array images as well as primary data analysis were performed using the Affymetrix software packages: Microarray Suite version 4.0.1, MicroDB version 2.0, and Data Mining Tool version 2.0. Microsoft Excel was used for further statistical analyses. All arrays were globally scaled to a target value of 150 using the average signal from all gene features using Microarray Suite version 4.0.1. When pairwise comparisons were performed (using Microarray Suite version 4.0.1), a transcript was considered “changed” when a call of Increase or Decrease was made, the -fold change was at least 2, and the higher of the two average difference values was called present. </Data-Processing>

When pairwise comparisons were performed (using Microarray Suite version 4.0.1), a transcript was considered “changed” when a call of Increase or Decrease was made, the -fold change was at least 2, and the higher of the two average difference values was called present. </Data-Processing>

      <Growth-Protocol> Chemostat Cultivation— Steady-state chemostat cultures were grown in Applikon laboratory fermentors of 1-liter working volume as described in detail elsewhere [van den Berg, M. A., de Jong-Gubbels, P., Kortland, C. J., van Dijken, J. P., Pronk, J. T., and Steensma, H. Y. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 28953–28959]. In brief, the cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium containing glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient [. Verduyn, C., Postma, E., Scheffers, W. A., and van Dijken, J. P. (1990) Microbiol.Rev. 58, 616–630]. The dilution rate (which equals the specific growth rate) in the steady-state cultures was 0.10 h_1, the temperature was 30 °C, and the culture pH was 5.0. For anaerobic cultivation, the reservoir medium was supplemented with Tween 80 and ergosterol as described previously. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by sparging the medium reservoir and the fermentor with pure nitrogen gas (0.5 liter_min_1). Furthermore, Norprene tubing and butyl rubber septa were used to minimize oxygen of Increase or Decrease was made, the -fold change was at least 2, and the higher of the two average difference values was called present. Media— The defined mineral medium composition was based on that described by Verduyn et al [. Verduyn, C., Postma, E., Scheffers, W. A., and van Dijken, J. P. (1990) Microbiol.Rev. 58, 616–630]. The residual glucose concentration was targeted to 17 g_liter_1 to sustain glucose repression at the same level . For phosphorus-limited cultivation: 5.0 g of (NH4)2SO4, 1.9 g of K2SO4, 0.12 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4.7H2O, and 66 g of glucose. </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>polyA RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol> Sampling and RNA Isolation— Samples from the chemostat cultures were taken as rapidly as possible to limit any potential changes in transcript profiles during the procedure. 40–60 ml of culture broth was sampled directly from the chemostat into a beaker containing 200 ml of liquid nitrogen. With vigorous stirring, the sample froze instantly. The frozen sample was then broken into small fragments and transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube. The sample was then thawed at room temperature, ensuring that it remained as close to zero as possible. Cells were pelleted (5000 rpm at 0 °C for 4 min), resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold AE buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 5.0) and aliquoted into 5 Eppendorf tubes. This corresponded to _20 mg of dry weight per tube. For each array, total RNA was extracted from a single tube using the hot-phenol method (32) or the FastRNA kit, Red (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotinylated-UTP SAPE-Phycoerythrin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol> Probe Preparation and Hybridization to Arrays—mRNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cRNA synthesis and labeling, as well as array hybridization were performed as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Briefly, poly(A)_ RNA was enriched from total RNA in a single round using the Qiagen Oligotex kit. Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out incorporating the T7 RNA-polymerase promoter in the first round. This cDNA was then used as template for in vitro transcription (ENZO BioArray High Yield IVT kit), which amplifies the RNA pool and incorporates biotinylated ribonucleotides required for the staining procedures after hybridization. 15 mg of fragmented, biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix yeast S98 arrays at 45 °C for 16 h as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Washing and staining of arrays were performed using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and scanning with the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner.. </Label-Protocol>

    <Description> Stock and seed cultures of strain BY4743 were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium (10 mg/ml yeast extract, 20 mg/ml bactopeptone, 20 mg/ml glucose, pH 6.5 ± 0.2), at 30°C until the A600 reached 0.8. Cells were centrifuged and the cell pellet was resuspended and dispersed in 1:20 diluted YPD medium at between 22 to 25 °C. An aliquot, which represent the control sample (T1), was removed for RNA extraction, and the remaining suspension was aliquoted into 9-cm diameter glass Petri dishes (15 ml/dish) for desiccation. Desiccation was carried out in a custom-fabricated controlled atmosphere desiccation system, at 22 to 25 °C. For more information on the unit and software, contact the corresponding author. A series of aliquots were withdrawn from the cell suspensions 18h (T2) after the start of the drying process. Samples were collected on a volume basis and were in the same ratio as collected at T1. Once dry (42 h), the water potential was adjusted to 20% relative humidity for a period of 72 hr. A sample was collected at this timepoint, representing the dry sample (Tdry). Dry cells were hydrated (22 to 25 °C ) using 1:20 diluted YPD medium, 15 ml per plate. Resuspended cells from the four plates were pooled in a sterile 250 ml flask. Samples were collected for various analyses at time points of 15 min (T4), 45 min (T5), 90 min (T6) and 360 min (T7) after the start of rehydration. Total RNA was isolated essentially as described (Schmitt, M. E., Brown, T. A., and Trumpower, B. L. (1990) Nucl. Acids Res. 18, 3091-3092). RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer, and its quality was assessed using the A260/A280 ratio. Target cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Y98 chips (GPL90) and raw image data was analyzed using the GeneChip Expression Analysis Software (Affymetrix). Probe set signals were processed by a Wilcoxon’s signed rank test and consolidated using a two-step linear mixed model. This sample is known as E1_T7_R3, 360 min. post rehydration. </Description>

    <Description> Stock and seed cultures of strain BY4743 were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium (10 mg/ml yeast extract, 20 mg/ml bactopeptone, 20 mg/ml glucose, pH 6.5 ± 0.2), at 30°C until the A600 reached 0.8. Cells were centrifuged and the cell pellet was resuspended and dispersed in 1:20 diluted YPD medium at between 22 to 25 °C. An aliquot, which represent the control sample (T1), was removed for RNA extraction, and the remaining suspension was aliquoted into 9-cm diameter glass Petri dishes (15 ml/dish) for desiccation. Desiccation was carried out in a custom-fabricated controlled atmosphere desiccation system, at 22 to 25 °C. For more information on the unit and software, contact the corresponding author. A series of aliquots were withdrawn from the cell suspensions 18h (T2) after the start of the drying process. Samples were collected on a volume basis and were in the same ratio as collected at T1. Once dry (42 h), the water potential was adjusted to 20% relative humidity for a period of 72 hr. A sample was collected at this timepoint, representing the dry sample (Tdry). Dry cells were hydrated (22 to 25 °C ) using 1:20 diluted YPD medium, 15 ml per plate. Resuspended cells from the four plates were pooled in a sterile 250 ml flask. Samples were collected for various analyses at time points of 15 min (T4), 45 min (T5), 90 min (T6) and 360 min (T7) after the start of rehydration. Total RNA was isolated essentially as described (Schmitt, M. E., Brown, T. A., and Trumpower, B. L. (1990) Nucl. Acids Res. 18, 3091-3092). RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer, and its quality was assessed using the A260/A280 ratio. Target cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Y98 chips (GPL90) and raw image data was analyzed using the GeneChip Expression Analysis Software (Affymetrix). Probe set signals were processed by a Wilcoxon’s signed rank test and consolidated using a two-step linear mixed model. This sample is known as E1_T3_R1, Dry. </Description>
