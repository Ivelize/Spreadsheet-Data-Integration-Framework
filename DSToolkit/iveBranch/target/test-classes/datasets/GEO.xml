      <Growth-Protocol> Chemostat Cultivation— Steady-state chemostat cultures were grown in Applikon laboratory fermentors of 1-liter working volume as described in detail elsewhere [van den Berg, M. A., de Jong-Gubbels, P., Kortland, C. J., van Dijken, J. P., Pronk, J. T., and Steensma, H. Y. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 28953–28959]. In brief, the cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium containing glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient [. Verduyn, C., Postma, E., Scheffers, W. A., and van Dijken, J. P. (1990) Microbiol.Rev. 58, 616–630]. The dilution rate (which equals the specific growth rate) in the steady-state cultures was 0.10 h_1, the temperature was 30 °C, and the culture pH was 5.0. Aerobic conditions were maintained by sparging the cultures with air (0.5 liter_min_1). The dissolved oxygen concentration, which was continuously monitored with an Ingold model 34-100-3002 probe, remained above 80% of air saturation. </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>polyA RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol> Sampling and RNA Isolation— Samples from the chemostat cultures were taken as rapidly as possible to limit any potential changes in transcript profiles during the procedure. 40–60 ml of culture broth was sampled directly from the chemostat into a beaker containing 200 ml of liquid nitrogen. With vigorous stirring, the sample froze instantly. The frozen sample was then broken into small fragments and transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube. The sample was then thawed at room temperature, ensuring that it remained as close to zero as possible. Cells were pelleted (5000 rpm at 0 °C for 4 min), resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold AE buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 5.0) and aliquoted into 5 Eppendorf tubes. This corresponded to _20 mg of dry weight per tube. For each array, total RNA was extracted from a single tube using the hot-phenol method (32) or the FastRNA kit, Red (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol> Probe Preparation and Hybridization to Arrays—mRNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cRNA synthesis and labeling, as well as array hybridization were performed as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Briefly, poly(A)_ RNA was enriched from total RNA in a single round using the Qiagen Oligotex kit. Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out incorporating the T7 RNA-polymerase promoter in the first round. This cDNA was then used as template for in vitro transcription (ENZO BioArray High Yield IVT kit), which amplifies the RNA pool and incorporates biotinylated ribonucleotides required for the staining procedures after hybridization. 15 mg of fragmented, biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix yeast S98 arrays at 45 °C for 16 h as described in the Affymetrix users’ manual (1). Washing and staining of arrays were performed using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and scanning with the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner.

For nitrogen-limited, the composition was 1.0 g of (NH4)2SO4, 5.3 g of K2SO4, 3.0 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4_7H2O, and 59 g of glucose. </Growth-Protocol>
