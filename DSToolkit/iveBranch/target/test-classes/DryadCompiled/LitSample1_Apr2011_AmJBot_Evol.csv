This study generates an extensive set of character reconstructions. 

This study re-uses sequence data from a previous study by an overlapping set of authors.  These data are used to add additional columns to the DNA matrix using manual alignment.  Morphological data apparently were drawn from an in-house database described as ""DELTA databse (H.P. Linder, in prep.)"", supplemented by additional character data described in the literature.  

The character data are available as a PDF on the journal's supplementary data site, and as an Excel spreadsheet from Dryad (http://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.8013). 

The state reconstructions are available on the journal web site as a PDF table.  The rows denote each interior node by number as well as by descendant OTUs, so that they can be uniquely identified.
