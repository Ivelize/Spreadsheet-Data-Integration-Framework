Elements at Loop 10 was composed and recorded at Perez\'s San Antonio studios and features guest appearances by vocalist Holly Nelson, James Sidlo of Honey Barbera fame, as well as the blissed out guitar craft of Damian Rodriguez.\n\n\"The initial concept was to create an album that had recognizable pop, rock, and electronic elements, but was not anchored to the typical cut and paste format that have become redundant on our airwaves,\" explains Perez.\n\nPerez and Rodriguez\' ongoing collaboration led the duo to explore different musical styles, an evolution most noticeable on their Magic Midsummer release, which they released under the name Mosaico.\n\n\"We had just finished Elements and we had already had several ideas for the Seventythree project, but like Elements it required a lot of attention,\" says Perez. \"Every sound and lyric had to be planned and manipulated in our studio. That\'s where the Mosaico project came in. We needed something raw, we needed the serendipity of rock and roll... with electronic instruments of course.\"\n\nWhether exploring the big electronic soundscapes of Elements and Seventythree or the more spontaneous sound of Magic Midsummer, Perez and Rodriguez consistently turn out darkly beautiful pop and electronic gems?the perfect soundtrack \"for whatever the night brings.\"\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(27,-6425423038373806924,'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description','','',2),(28,-4675163487866894548,'lavish, trippy synth rock','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(29,2866265301089260405,'http://purl.org/ontology/mo/MusicArtist','','',2),(30,1944080680679009613,'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage','','',2),(31,4695296148240108556,'http://magnatune.com/artists/liquid_zen','','',2),(32,-452321797200972181,'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/img','','',2),(33,-5452490371844324206,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/liquid_zen.jpg','','',2),(34,9118236499074508204,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/performance/3837','','',2),(35,-8338087251712200151,'http://purl.org/ontology/mo/recorded_as','','',2),(36,-5528278989787731208,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/signal/3837','','',2),(37,-3856492407054351774,'http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#place','','',2),(38,-8891111734675200070,'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norway','','',2),(39,-85198007419118777,'http://purl.org/ontology/mo/performer','','',2),(40,2701472441990673026,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mot','','',2),(41,-2616528519137838529,'performance 3837','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(42,-1782785381243737280,'http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment','','',2),(43,-1769132744502886926,'I wonder it it is really useful for now, but it can be an anchor point for further information','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(44,-4767000441971783892,'http://purl.org/ontology/mo/Performance','','',2),(45,5612804267854841736,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/2158','','',2),(46,7408681628789494658,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/hans_christian','','',2),(47,-2983215598174415567,'Arabesque','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(48,-847818638192232984,'2003-10-05','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date',50),(49,9043545756705053636,'7','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(50,-7121379173146882040,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/07-Arabesque-Hans%20Christian.mp3','','',2),(51,8729159157482348946,'https://magnatune.com/artists/buy_album?artist=Hans+Christian&album=Phantoms&genre=New+Age','','',2),(52,7425517650880564289,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeline/2793','','',2),(53,4288505304645444192,'timeline 2793','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(54,-4239347347161499732,'http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/timeline.owl#RelativeTimeLine','','',2),(55,-1761184440398778529,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/norine','','',2),(56,-2666057866240737932,'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada','','',2),(57,-5808233684514422998,'Norine Braun','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(58,-6667296403082339239,'Norine Braun\'s music has always existed on its own terms, falling into that titillating, refreshingly original space to the left of \"trendy,\" craftily sidestepping the all-too-easily-dismissed stigma often applied to the \"female singer/songwriter,\" and freewheeling unhindered around the rigid shackles of \"genre. \"\n\nAlong with savvy producer and multi-instrumentalist James Bowers, Braun has accumulated an extraordinary discography of unpretentious, personal songs anchored by her sweet, confident voice and genteel composition. Together, the pair crafts tuneful, friendly songs with subtle but effective arrangements, dynamic and graceful and memorable.\n\nNow, Braun is back with her fifth CD, NOW & ZEN, and on these fourteen tracks Braun shows an even greater depth and maturity. NOW & ZEN expands on her penchant for jazzed up, funk-tinged pop, and shows this gifted songstress taking bold steps on her soulful journey into self-exploration. The torch song, \"Move the Clouds,\" is evocative and inspirational, anchored by easy lounge piano and a melody as delicate as flower petals. The groovy \"J\'en Suis Desolee\" showcases Braun\'s confident rap, surprising and rocking with an edgy explosion of homegirl verve.\n\nArtsy and intellectual, tuneful and savvy, Norine Braun will zing to the heart of any listener. Norine Braun\'s repertoire ranges from ethereal, reflective moods to sizzling bluesy rock that test the limit of popular music. She is inspired by the struggle to find meaning in the human experience. Her lyrics, although provocative, do not lose touch with her whimsical nature.\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(59,-4828622954145760827,'jazzed up, funk-tinged eclectic pop.','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(60,2006975105603781037,'http://magnatune.com/artists/norine','','',2),(61,-6273507061764742297,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/norine.jpg','','',2),(62,8591099609309448662,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3151','','',2),(63,1601212216899944318,'Suite No 5 in G major BWV 816: Bourree','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(64,-5576021351700662578,'24','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(65,3976890052395522708,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/24-Suite%20No%205%20in%20G%20major%20BWV%20816_%20Bourree-Katherine%20Roberts%20Perl.mp3','','',2),(66,-1129946783453286393,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4024','','',2),(67,5412443886247330560,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mountain_mirrors','','',2),(68,3560585963650252193,'Deploribus Unum','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(69,-4234453454940891051,'2006-04-15','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date',50),(70,-7993280579524156581,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/07-Deploribus%20Unum-Mountain%20Mirrors.mp3','','',2),(71,-5080663917030101851,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3131','','',2),(72,-6050607188645846243,'Suite No 4 in E flat major BWV 815: Gavotte','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(73,8068456895353115236,'4','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(74,3900615393949542864,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/04-Suite%20No%204%20in%20E%20flat%20major%20BWV%20815_%20Gavotte-Katherine%20Roberts%20Perl.mp3','','',2),(75,-3310585164542141329,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4644','','',2),(76,-5116571902999942104,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/pbo','','',2),(77,6475241986767256656,'Aria: Non sara poco','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(78,-5627192242809353561,'2006-05-03','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date',50),(79,39177332584481951,'19','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(80,-4739785164395935914,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/19-Aria_%20Non%20sara%20poco-Philharmonia%20Baroque%20Orchestra.mp3','','',2),(81,6350503335764888264,'https://magnatune.com/artists/buy_album?artist=Philharmonia+Baroque&album=Handel+%2D+Atalanta+CD1&ge','','',2),(82,7407663259960019394,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4806','','',2),(83,-5918869888503555616,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/psychokinetics','','',2),(84,1016440493379441355,'The Hypnotist','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(85,932222845101669323,'2','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(86,-2991528704967542828,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/02-The%20Hypnotist-Psychokinetics.mp3','','',2),(87,-2631310894808498426,'https://magnatune.com/artists/buy_album?artist=Psychokinetics&album=Seven+League+Boots&genre=Rock','','',2),(88,-4904357689875183444,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4812','','',2),(89,-3906410496737468706,'Family Affair','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(90,-4324806982511628211,'8','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(91,6936010738709483351,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/08-Family%20Affair-Psychokinetics.mp3','','',2),(92,-2245645521159206578,'Psychokinetics','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(93,-6123281859349436924,'\nHailing from the astoundingly talented depths of the Bay Area\'s independent music scene, Psychokinetics have been moving crowds with their bangin\' beats, positive vibes, and distinct brand of underground hip-hop since 1995. Delivering hip-hop in its most pure and creative state, this classic recipe of one DJ (Denizen) and two Emcees (Celsius 7 and Spidey) provide consistent heat that has been attracting not only a larger fan base of late, but also an impressive string of musical cameos and collaborators such as Omega of Blackalicious and Raashan Ahmad of Crown City Rockers.\n\nDrawing on a wide range of production talent (DJ Denizen, DJ Ill Media, Dirt Nasty, and Slurface Tone), Psychokinetics are known for delivering a catchy underground sound that appeals to fans of Gorillaz, Ghostface Killah, and De La Soul. With styles ranging from bass heavy party anthems and rhymes flipped over jungle beats to downtempo reflective tracks and scratch laden instrumentals, Psychokinetics constantly demonstrate all the many the benefits of their long histories as musicians together; Celcius 7 and Spidey have amazing back-and-forth flow as Emcees and the group delivers a tight, polished sound that gets heads nodding and butts shaking.\n\nOn their latest album, Seven League Boots the four man crew eases off of the experimentation from their debut and focuses more on hip-hop that walks the fine line between underground and accessible. By blending the introspective and lyrical tracks like \"Badlands\" with bouncy dance tunes like \"Feeldismusick\" and \"Bigtime\" (Featuring Zion I), Psychokinetics are poised to garner a larger following throughout the hip hop community and beyond.\n\nNot only do Psychokinetics deliver in the studio, but the band is known for an energetic, engaging, and infectious live show as well. They\'ve built a strong fan base from Japan to Denver to Hawaii, and of course the Bay Area, where they\'ve shared the stage with such hip-hop luminaries including KRS-One, Biz Markee, DJ Premier, Black Sheep, Digital Underground, Kool Keith, and more. In addition to winning a John Lennon Songwriting Award, the Psychokinetics placed as finalists in the Musicians Atlas Independent Music Awards for best hip hop artist.\n\nIn the words of Celcius 7, \"This is music for the people, the artists, the dancers, the emcees, the DJs, those who love soulful music, and those who embrace the trials and celebrations of being alive.\" Watch out for these breakthrough artists as they extensively tour in support of Seven League Boots, and keep an eye out for their narrative lounge album due out in 2006.\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(94,-8062865419855219811,'mind-bendingly great Bay Area hip-hop','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(95,982132696648189894,'http://magnatune.com/artists/psychokinetics','','',2),(96,-3003128918476340775,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/psychokinetics.jpg','','',2),(97,-8365901573175661138,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/album/psychokinetics-seven','','',2),(98,6734922274183026956,'http://purl.org/ontology/mo/track','','',2),(99,1519747474672759118,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4811','','',2),(100,-2938216028923073519,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4808','','',2),(101,-1110910352741040631,'Seven League Boots','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(102,-4883042241922069698,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4813','','',2),(103,1665644721440852180,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4814','','',2),(104,-6993722132720683426,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4807','','',2),(105,-4604798558055907200,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4805','','',2),(106,-7865954453083479769,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4809','','',2),(107,5972213898720427474,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4815','','',2),(108,-3500949352765842153,'http://purl.org/ontology/mo/Record','','',2),(109,5968033667854174047,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4810','','',2),(110,-6287134180910182090,'http://purl.org/ontology/mo/publishing_location','','',2),(111,-3236867101453684356,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeinterval/5339','','',2),(112,-51770018919817711,'http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/timeline.owl#onTimeLine','','',2),(113,1809309833617802596,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeline/5339','','',2),(114,3849525216499246756,'http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/timeline.owl#duration','','',2),(115,8792978034002470273,'PT206S','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#duration',50),(116,-3716140974750927823,'time interval 5339','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(117,8971588674451042908,'http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/Interval','','',2),(118,5326854058768842419,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeline/5655','','',2),(119,2443922318798977356,'timeline 5655','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(120,9066328129271872426,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4634','','',2),(121,3323973829512680087,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/09-Aria_%20S\'e%20tuo%20piacer%20ch\'io%20mora-Philharmonia%20Baroque%20Orchestra.mp3','','',2),(122,1148624657348116858,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3152','','',2),(123,-510422970770741927,'Suite No 5 in G major BWV 816: Loure','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(124,3704657221170543664,'25','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(125,-3882641140494340957,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/25-Suite%20No%205%20in%20G%20major%20BWV%20816_%20Loure-Katherine%20Roberts%20Perl.mp3','','',2),(126,-7696720364790460954,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/paternoster','','',2),(127,-3851559253839182227,'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy','','',2),(128,9062324033733127358,'Vito Paternoster','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(129,-8006224825136084350,'Vito Paternoster graduated from the conservatory of S.

Since that time Perl has developed both a unique teaching and playing style for which she has become well known?one that celebrates the dynamic and expressive aspects of the harpsichord and is influenced by the American idioms of blues and jazz.\n\nWhile conventional ideas of the harpsichord hold that it does not allow for variation in volume, Perl\'s powerful playing overturns this perception, and mines the expressive capacity of the instrument. Her innovative approach has been termed \"sound sculpture.\"\n\nMs. Perl\'s first recording, Pieces de Clavecin, Music of Louis Couperin was nominated for Best Baroque Recording of French music in 1993, in Paris. The second recording, Music of Jacques Duphly, was released in 1998 on the Dorian label and most recently Perl\'s independent recording of four of Bach\'s French Suites has been made available on Magnatune. Bach\'s classic composition for harpsichord, The Well-Tempered Clavier, has now become the center of Perl\'s artistic attention and future recordings and releases are in the works.\n\nIn addition to her performing, teaching, and recording activities, Katherine Roberts Perl is an esteemed harpsichord technician, serving the Bay Area. She and her husband Mark produce a concert series/salon in their home in San Francisco called Chattanooga Chamber Music, which consists of four live music performances every fall and spring.\n\n\"I consider myself extremely fortunate that my life thus far has been contemporary with many great masters,\" says Perl, \"who have shown the way for practitioners of early music performance in my own generation and the next: musicians such as Gustav Leonhardt, the Kuijken brothers and Hopkinson Smith, to name a few.\" She adds, \"My mission in life is to play the music of Bach, Couperin and others on the harpsichord with clarity and grace, and to teach others what it takes to do so. Meaningful expression is an elusive thing, and so wondrous when it is achieved.\"\n\nAdditional Praise for Katherine Roberts Perl:\n\n\"The key to Roberts\' success is her fluent but precise rhythmic sense. She has a way of springing the rhythm, drawing out the line, waiting until the last possible moment before attacking a note without damaging the onward flow in the slightest. Strength and delicacy, nuance and bite seemed available in abundance...a fluent but precise rhythmic sense.\" ?Charles Shere, Oakland Tribune\n\n\"She genuinely captured the essence of accurate, sensitive and stylistic French keyboard playing...the audience was enraptured...passion and fire.\" ?Ruta Bloomfield, Iowa

Their sound betrays them as big followers of the music of 80s; their members are indeed fans of very varied bands that go from Depeche Mode to The Smiths, from The Cure to Portishead, from Aviador Dro to Lamb or from Fangoria to Covenant.\n\nSelf-Delusion has been a supporting act for bands such as Wolfsheim and De/Vision, VNV Nation and Apoptygma Berzerk.\n\nWith \"Happiness hurts\", Self-Delusion makes a move to find a place in the electronic national scene as they have obtained it, occasionally, in the international one, where they have managed to edit and to receive prizes as the fourth position in the Clavia MP3 Competition (contest organized by the well known synths manufacturer Clavia -nordlead-) thanks their song \"Christine\", included in \"Happiness hurts me\".\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(222,-5949776526177788373,'darkly addictive electro-pop songs','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(223,-4138056824700771268,'http://magnatune.com/artists/self_delusion','','',2),(224,-940272781032512004,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/selfdelusion1.jpg','','',2),(225,-5054636139083138768,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3837','','',2),(226,3759607968740873667,'After Thought','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(227,3507958503331238060,'2004-05-20','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date',50),(228,-6309706752402048078,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/02-After%20Thought-Memories%20of%20Tomorrow.mp3','','',2),(229,2516143214236238542,'https://magnatune.com/artists/buy_album?artist=Memories+of+Tomorrow&album=Waiting+for+Dawn&genre=Ele','','',2),(230,2938652718792535088,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3149','','',2),(231,-6647796972866744765,'Suite No 5 in G major BWV 816: Sarabande','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(232,-6146056089428492926,'22','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(233,8316426019692887285,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/22-Suite%20No%205%20in%20G%20major%20BWV%20816_%20Sarabande-Katherine%20Roberts%20Perl.mp3','','',2),(234,-2817858782654590554,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4230','','',2),(235,-322802502294898171,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/02-I\'d%20Guess%20You\'d%20Say-Norine%20Braun.mp3','','',2),(236,-4250368608940576811,'https://magnatune.com/artists/buy_album?artist=Norine+Braun&album=Modern+Anguish&genre=Pop','','',2),(237,2160928280323838740,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3110','','',2),(238,8211890012588932842,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/bianco','','',2),(239,2911317242863401662,'Still','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(240,6265637270929709504,'2006-05-29','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date',50),(241,-8473093630031814175,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/13-Still-Justin%20Bianco.mp3','','',2),(242,-6467951935384808841,'https://magnatune.com/artists/buy_album?artist=Justin+Bianco&album=Forge&genre=New+Age','','',2),(243,5407020016638968763,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3143','','',2),(244,-1647898662746172279,'Suite No 3 in B minor BWV 814: Sarabande','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(245,7677531463482561734,'16','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int',50),(246,3911307149721547641,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/16-Suite%20No%203%20in%20B%20minor%20BWV%20814_%20Sarabande-Katherine%20Roberts%20Perl.mp3','','',2),(247,2227624507864034255,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/soulprint','','',2),(248,-975672491571129649,'SoulPrint','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(249,-2868682924398362865,'How heavy can rock get? Heavier than you think. SoulPrint is redefining rock. No catchy pop here, just the best soulful hard rock that will make you rethink your existence. The apocalypse is now. SoulPrint has been shattering eardrums along the central coast for nearly five years, and once LaBarre graduates @ Cal Poly, they plan to tour the United States.\n\nJason Estes: Jason shows his dedication by driving back and forth from his hometown of Santa Barbara to SLO at least three times a week, just for the band. His passions for singing and expressing himself distinguish him greatly from other vocalists. There\'s not much else to say about him... and he never really has much to say.\n\nRyan Estes: AKA Rage. If you know him, you know why this is such a fitting nickname. Attempts with every new song to play more chords, and faster. Has a thing for breaking strings and falling over on stage\n\nJohn Reisz: John started playing drums just so the band could form. Seven years later... he adds his own unique flow to the edginess of the thrashing guitars. That is, if he isn\'t pounding away at the double kick.\n\nRyan LaBarre: The newest member of the band and the only one not born and raised in SLO, Ryan hails from way in up Portland, Oregon. He started out playing guitar, but was drawn to the powerful sounds of the bass two years ago. Less than a week after meeting Rage and Flow at Cal Poly, he found himself playing a show with them at a party in Isla Vista. Luckily, the fans were as drunk as he was, so it didn\'t matter that he was totally winging it. Now, thank god, he actually knows what he\'s doing on stage.\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(250,-3010356699766380662,'soulful hard

This instrument has a pentatonic tuning and has 5 holes like the shakuhachi, but has a much deeper and more mellow sound than the shakuhachi.\n\nIt used to be played more often in the old days of Japan, but was more and more replaced by the shakuhachi during the twentieth century.\n\nIn the same process it changed from an instrument of meditation that was mainly used by a certain buddhist sect of wandering monks (komuso), who played traditional religious pieces (honkyoku) only, to an instrument of more \'worldly\' use played with other instruments and in different kinds of music.\n\nTilopa\'s master, Koku Nishimura, was one of the first to revive the old tradition of kyotaku.\n\nFor a few years now, Tilopa has been giving occasional concerts with Sangeet P. Sieben. Sieben is a gifted guitarist who started out with jazz and rock music years ago, picked up other instruments on his musical life journey and now feels very much at home with ethno-, world- and meditation-music. One of the results of this extraordinary meeting is the CD \'Pictures of Silence\', which is a live recording of several improvisational sessions at an art exhibition in Cologne/Germany.\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(380,9135040445699079104,'healing magic of the japanese zenflute','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(381,6316814742196854466,'http://magnatune.com/artists/tilopa','','',2),(382,-6373546285512757762,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/tilopa1.jpg','','',2),(383,-7871082426694449343,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4637','','',2),(384,742293906004183051,'Recitativo: Ah che pur troppo adoro','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(385,8979565314209139213,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/12-Recitativo_%20Ah%20che%20pur%20troppo%20adoro-Philharmonia%20Baroque%20Orchestra.mp3','','',2),(386,-4635172097386723055,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/682','','',2),(387,-6420041966715447742,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/brad_sucks','','',2),(388,-3025343171308695991,'Fixing My Brain','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(389,3912951734210299903,'2003-12-19','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date',50),(390,-9143051678166368498,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/03-Fixing%20My%20Brain-Brad%20Sucks.mp3','','',2),(391,5797039875927643335,'https://magnatune.com/artists/buy_album?artist=Brad+Sucks&album=I+Dont+Know+What+Im+Doing&genre=Rock','','',2),(392,-3704534345582681718,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4638','','',2),(393,-4272068760360903249,'Aria: Come alla tortorella langue','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(394,9110824826953127460,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/13-Aria_%20Come%20alla%20tortorella%20langue-Philharmonia%20Baroque%20Orchestra.mp3','','',2),(395,-3670130943415089045,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3137','','',2),(396,-6110862169772196140,'Suite No 2 in C minor BWV 813: Sarabande','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(397,-5271845871294849086,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/10-Suite%20No%202%20in%20C%20minor%20BWV%20813_%20Sarabande-Katherine%20Roberts%20Perl.mp3','','',2),(398,-8369899643442110000,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/performance/3511','','',2),(399,5512054296704072982,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/signal/3511','','',2),(400,1313851520077060518,'performance 3511','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(401,-6892191739661282113,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/signal/6271','','',2),(402,-1785425164513149413,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeinterval/6271','','',2),(403,-8955446174740619038,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/6271','','',2),(404,1634572690474389060,'signal 6271','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(405,7721939370318006318,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/signal/682','','',2),(406,-2428991420157542736,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeinterval/682','','',2),(407,9150569846472501151,'signal 682','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(408,490259117280325538,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/album/kperl-french','','',2),(409,-4524906654215791974,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3133','','',2),(410,6587226281032670591,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3146','','',2),(411,-2956265071579508303,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/3136','','',2),(412,-8319105041355468238,'J.S.

As his tastes broadened, however, he began bringing in folk influences such as Nick Drake and Damien Rice, and creating the hypnotic folk-rock for which he is known today. It\'s this melodic yet mesmerizing sound that Sanders uses to explore issues of spirituality. Although his music expresses a deep yearning for enlightenment, it\'s Sanders\' willingness to examine the eerie, lonely side of this quest that makes his music so powerful.\n\nThough these dark, even spooky influences are definitely felt throughout his work, Sanders\' music also contains a deep vein of introspection that keep it from being menacing. One reviewer described the first Mountain Mirrors album, Lunar Ecstasy, as a work \"fit for poets, travelers and seekers,\" while another called it \"the perfect chill-out album with brief touches of Delerium, Alice in Chains, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Portishead and The Tea Party.\" In February 2004, Lunar Ecstasy was named album of the month by both IndieSoundz and StonedGods, and \"Afterlife\" was chosen by Indie Music Beat Magazine for their annual 101 Great New Music Tracks CD.\n\nThe eponymous Mountain Mirrors album is Sanders\' second full length album, and shows a deepening mastery of his intense, supernatural sound. Guest musicians include Elad Fish on drums and piano, Claire Fitch on cello, Oren Selas on keyboards, and Guy Bar-Tor on bass. \"They\'re phenomenal, absolutely sent from heaven,\" says Sanders.\n\nSays The Sound Monitor of Mountain Mirrors, \"From atmospheric sounds to Massive Attack style trip-hop with your more standard acoustic guitar & soft singing tracks. The music takes you on numerous twists and turns throughout dark and beautiful landscapes from your dreams and nightmares.\"\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(500,-6079292524765450020,'heavy acoustic from the woods of Mass.','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(501,-5707790201513535318,'http://magnatune.com/artists/mountain_mirrors','','',2),(502,7040493405739739356,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/mirrors.jpg','','',2),(503,-4695337534977104,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeinterval/6124','','',2),(504,1322142738703722536,'PT611S','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#duration',50),(505,5816720020956681307,'time interval 6124','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(506,-2805355142800801202,'Your Time Has Come','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(507,3040362753836204206,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/04-Your%20Time%20Has%20Come-Mountain%20Mirrors.mp3','','',2),(508,3975945702422774879,'Trevor Pinnock and Jonathan Ma','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(509,3957347114661857391,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/pinnock1.jpg','','',2),(510,-1064977002925546215,'Trevor Pinnock','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(511,-5546636778468211772,'Trevor Pinnock is recognised as a leading personality in the direction of period-instrument performance and a harpsichord soloist of international reputation.\n\nHaving trained as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and as a scholar at the Royal College of Music, Trevor Pinnock formed The English Concert in 1973; since then, his lively and stylish interpretations with this ensemble have set new standards in the field of period performance.\n\nTrevor Pinnock has appeared frequently as a guest conductor with many of the world\'s leading orchestras, including the Boston, San Francisco and Detroit Symphony orchestras, the St Paul and Los Angeles Chamber orchestras and at the Tanglewood and Mostly Mozart festivals, he became Principal conductor and artistic director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Ottawa.

Under the leadership of Nicholas McGegan, Music Director since 1985, Philharmonia has become \"an ensemble for early music as fine as any in the world today,\" according to Los Angeles Times critic Alan Rich. The Orchestra performs a subscription season in four cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is regularly heard on tour in United States and internationally. In addition to Mr. McGegan, the Orchestra has welcomed eminent guest conductors to its podium including William Christie, Andrew Parrott, Jordi Savall, Gustav Leonhart, Monica Huggett and Stanley Ritchie.\n\nUnder the direction of Mr. McGegan, Philharmonia has made several United States tours, each of which included an appearance on the Great Performers Series at Lincoln Center. Other appearances include debuts at Carnegie Hall (NY) and Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles) in February 2005. In August of 2005 the Orchestra made its debut at the BBC Proms, Snape Maltings (UK) and The Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\n\nIn August 2002, the Orchestra made its Mostly Mozart Festival debut with five performances including a concert featuring Handel\'s newly-discovered Gloria in excelsis Deo and four performances of Handel\'s L\'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato with Mark Morris Dance Group. A return engagement in August 2003 featured the Orchestra in the Festival\'s first fully-staged opera, Mozart\'s Il re pastore. In March of 1998 Philharmonia performed Handel\'s Saul and Hercules at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and in 1999 the Orchestra made its European debut at the International Handel Festival in Gottingen, Germany, with return appearances in 2001 and 2002.\n\nIn 1990, Philharmonia began an extremely successful collaboration with the Mark Morris Dance Group. In May of that year, the Orchestra appeared at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the Dance Group in Morris\' production of Purcell\'s Dido and Aeneas. Subsequent performances have included a program of mixed works featuring Vivaldi\'s Gloria; Handel\'s L\'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, presented again in March of 2000 and September of 2003 by UC Berkeley\'s Cal Performances; and the American premiere of Morris\' production of Rameau\'s ballet-opera Platee, which was the tour de force of the 1998 Berkeley Festival.

journey began many years ago in Germany by studying the cello. \"I started to play when I was nine years old and had a private teacher for 10 years. Although my teacher imposed a strict and disciplined approach to learning the instrument I remember him fondly; he was preparing me to go to the music conservatory to become a professional cellist. Deep in my heart, though, I knew all along that this was not going to happen.\" His life was to unfold along different lines.\n\nSince his father was a minister at a Lutheran church in Hanover, Hans played in that church many times and confesses some early musical adventures: \"I would steal the key to the church from my father\'s desk sometimes and sneak into the church to play there at night. It was dark and cold, but the acoustics were amazing. I am talking about a building in the Neo-Gothic style, big enough for almost a thousand people. So, I would sit in front of the altar, that sacred space, and I didn\'t know if I was violating God\'s space or was welcome. I loved those anxious moments and expressed my emotions in wild improvisations.\"\n\nThe unyielding urge to express himself led him to pick up the bass guitar as a teenager and get absorbed in rock music. \"I would play along with Hendrix records, and Santana, Pink Floyd and the Doors. I started to play in local bands in Hanover, dressing outrageously and wearing makeup. I lived out my wild fantasies one night while playing classical music the next day. I liked the discipline of the cello studies and the wildness of the rock bands.\"\n\nPerhaps this duality is a key ingredient to understanding Hans Christian\'s music and his approach to his own compostions and to his work with RASA, his well-known collaboration with singer Kim Waters. Often starting with a simple melody, Hans weaves an unconventional orchestral treatment that adds a very dense and multi-layered quality to his music, not shying away from any combination of instruments- but always guided by a strong sense of melody and musical development.\n\nHans acknowledges, \"Whether it is with RASA or on my solo projects, I try to keep it very listenable but very interesting, too. I want the listener to travel with the music and have their own experiences.\"\n\nWhen he was 21 years old he decided to move to Los Angeles to study bass at Musician\'s Institute in Hollywood. It was a big adventure, not knowing anybody in LA and without a place to stay. But within six weeks of his arrival he played at the Whiskey on Sunset Blvd, and within a year he was very connected to the local music scene. \"I played every hole-in-the-wall club you can imagine, constantly playing with many different kinds of groups, from dark and hard-etched bands to folk and performance artists. It was a fulfillment of my dreams because I could do whatever I wanted, and I tried many different things.\"\n\nEventually he worked with established artists like Robbie Robertson, Toni Childs, Victoria Williams, and the Sparks, appearing live and on television. But a persistent urge to express his own ideas kept him on the run. \"I felt a strong pull towards doing my own music, to go deeper, and so I stretched out on the cello, practicing constantly, composing difficult pieces and pushing myself very hard.\"\n\nThis creative drive led him to start his own production company, Allemande Music, expanding into all aspects of music production. Besides recording his own music and the music of RASA, Hans has produced and engineered a rich variety of recording projects with other artists. After almost ten years in the San Francisco area, Hans and his partner, Kim Waters, have recently relocated to Door County, Wisconsin, where they have built yet another recording studio. Hans says about this move that \"I wanted to fulfill this dream of living in a four season environment where it is beautiful, clean, and quiet, so that I can focus on my work more easily. California is a great place to network but it became too exhausting to live there.\"\n\nWhile RASA is the main focus of Hans\' musical activities with four CDs in the last four years and an active touring schedule, he has just re-mastered his two most recent solo projects (Phantoms and Surrender) which are re-released through Magnatune.com and a few other companies. Additional solo recordings can be expected in the near future.\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(610,4164635783567673721,'new age meets Indian cello','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(611,-4714696256199010639,'http://magnatune.com/artists/hans_christian','','',2),(612,7038009618732745680,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/hans_christian.jpg','','',2),(613,-7365460433438652954,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4628','','',2),(614,-8330804421313140126,'Andante','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(615,-320849732166783219,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/03-Andante-Philharmonia%20Baroque%20Orchestra.mp3','','',2),(616,7889275647705951500,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/album/pbo-atalanta1','','',2),(617,-3890082186314672819,'Handel - Atalanta CD1','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(618,1135023194086255579,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4647','','',2),(619,-3322265457746933696,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/track/4633','','',2),(620,2898835044806061427,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeline/2673','','',2),(621,-4162415687946269006,'timeline 2673','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(622,-4527644159248114291,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/22-Aria_%20Lassa%20ch\'io%20t\'ho%20perduta-Philharmonia%20Baroque%20Orchestra.mp3','','',2),(623,7424519195956638588,'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slovakia','','',2),(624,6639746177209661000,'Strojovna 07','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(625,4380815536916007673,'Strojovna 07 is a project of two people who go by the name RA100 and ?ISH.

By delving into the very depths of Renaissance culture their semi-staged performances unearth the archetypal and timeless quality of this music. Hannah Morrison\'s pure and sweet voice combined with the lilting citterns, gitterns, lutes, and flutes of Dominik Schneider and Mark Wheeler bring to life the passionate music of a distant age.\n\nPantagruel, the hero of a 1532 novel by Francois Rabelais, maintained the motto \"do, what thou wilt,\" and is a fitting name for an ensemble dedicated to exploring innovative methods of performance and presentation. Combining painstaking musicological research with their experience in classical music, rock, jazz, theater, and dance, Pantagruel\'s performances push the envelop of classical concert conventions by using Renaissance practices of medley, improvisation, and gesture.\n\nRecent Pantagruel performances have included concerts at the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Utrecht Early Music Festival, Munster Baroque festival, and collaboration with Andrew Lawrence-King (Harp Consort, Hesperion XX).\n\nTheir debut CD Elizium breaks boundaries to produce an album of painstaking authenticity, with a structure and intensity that bears comparison with the concept albums of 70\'s rock bands such as Pink Floyd. Elizium is set in Elizabethan England at the court of the Faerie Queene Elizabeth I, whose influence in modern pop culture can be seen in Tolkiens\' Elven Queen Galadriel.\n\nArtist Bios\n\nHannah Morrison (Voyce) The daughter of Scottish and Icelandic musicians, it was in the Netherlands at the Musikhochschule Maastricht that she gained her BA, studying with the soprano Barbara Schlick. She has received further inspiration during master classes with Anthony Rooley, Evelyn Tubb and Andrew Lawrence- King.\n\nDominik Schneider (Flutes, Gittern & Voyce) From an early age he began to play every instrument he could get his hands on, but finally ended up studying the recorder at the Folkwang Musikhochschule in Essen and later renaissance and baroque traverse flutes at the Cologne Musikhochschule.\n\nMark Wheeler (Lutes, Cittern & Gittern) Born in Wordsley/England, he discovered his passion for plucked string instruments while listening to Led Zeppelin. His lute studies with Nigel North at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London have been complemented by master classes, with amongst others Jakob Lindberg & Julian Bream.\n','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(639,4575483565054323181,'dazzlingly innovative early music','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(640,7310619857038683643,'http://magnatune.com/artists/pantagruel','','',2),(641,-6652588953019054043,'http://magnatune.com//artists/img/pantagruel.jpg','','',2),(642,7170166749993731352,'PT288S','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#duration',50),(643,-8239923751399836953,'time interval 6413','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(644,-5233444642036201675,'Suite No 5 in G major BWV 816: Allemande','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(645,-5834088357061944537,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/20-Suite%20No%205%20in%20G%20major%20BWV%20816_%20Allemande-Katherine%20Roberts%20Perl.mp3','','',2),(646,8807673955391299763,'http://dbtune.org/magnatune/timeline/5685','','',2),(647,-1282889178710116827,'timeline 5685','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(648,7485873930078770542,'Bigtime','','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string',4),(649,2884845448629344376,'http://he3.magnatune.com/all/05-Bigtime-Psychokinetics.mp3','','',2);
